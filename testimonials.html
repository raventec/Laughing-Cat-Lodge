    <p>Guy Marchi, owner and proprietor of the Laughing Cat Lodge, has provided excellent care for my cats on numerous occasions. My cats were picked up
and dropped off conveniently by Guy himself. He was both patient and gentle when Chaos acted out before the car trip.  Misty requires insulin  injections twice daily for her diabetes and Guy was more than qualified to administer these. Moreover, his facility is always clean, calm and quiet
with loads of stimulation for those more active cats, like my Chaos!  He plays calming music and provides appropriate choices for toys, catnip and the likes for those cats who are so inclined. He even has cat videos with
birds, etc!</p>
    <p>Most importantly,  I never once felt concerned or worried while I was away on business or vacation as I whole heartedly could put my trust into the
caring hands of Guy's expertise with my cats at the Laughing Cat Lodge, formerly the Spoiled Cat Rainforest Retreat.</p>
    <p>I would personally recommend Guy's service at the Laughing Cat Lodge to any discerning cat owner.</p>
  </div>
    <p>Thanks Guy for your past service and all the times you will continue to care for my "babies" in the future!</p>
